# Project Overview
For my project I used the following tools to create my graphs
1. ThreeJS
2. D3
3. Python(plotly.express)
4. Google Sheets
5. Flourish

## Technical Achivements
My technical achivement was using ThreeJS to create my graph. This is a library I'm trying to relearn. Using this library was a lot of work since there is no built in graph functionallity so I had to create my axis' including labels.

Additionally I added the feature to spin around the graph in the ThreeJS one which isn't very useful but is fun.

## Design Achivements
My design achivement was keeping consistant point colors(expect google sheets that program just sucks).

Another achivement was have the threejs graph take up the enite window when launched.

This was the worst possible way to graph this data but... I loved the result and it was fun to make. There were so many problems I ran into when making this. To make my axis' I had to map the car's value to canvas dimensions(mpg/weight) to the canvas cordinates. I would not reccoment this for creating a quick graph but it makes an cool visual. I felt like I had way too much control over what I wanted to for this visualization(Was a lot like reinventing the wheel).

I had a good experience with this. I used starter code from
https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/scatter_grouped.html

I had a pretty smooth experience with this. I felt that I had a lot of control comparted to googlesheets and python. The only issue I ran into was creating the axis labels which I figured out.

# Python using plotly.express

This code was really fast to write but didn't give me the most control. I wish it was easier to control the sizes of bubbles I felt like no matter what I did they were always a little to big.

# Google Sheets

This was probably the worst expierience I had which I was supprised about. Everything felt difficult to do and hard to find. It could of been just my skill with the program but it just wasn't fun to make.

# Flourish

This was the best experience I had making this graph. The enitire system was EXTREMELY user friendly. Being a new user I was able to create the exact graph I wanted within 5 minutes which is just insane and I felt like I had all the control I wanted.
